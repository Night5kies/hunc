Initial Version of HUNC Website!!!
Built with React and NextJS by Kevin McLeod 

Schedule page not added yet and most pages are pretty basic. There is no backend, literally all frontend so should be pretty straightforward 

Used framer-motion for all animations https://motion.dev/ 
Used Scroll Carousel for Past Events Page https://asif-jalil.github.io/scroll-carousel-website/ 
    MAKE SURE THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 IMAGES FOR EACH EVENT FOR SCROLL CAROUSEL TO WORK PROPERLY OTHERWISE IT LOOKS ALL MESSED UP 

CSS implemented pretty messily, cleanup task for future Tech Chairs if I don't get around to it haha o7

Website hosted on Vercel
